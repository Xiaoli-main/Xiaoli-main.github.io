# Achievements

Prof Li is internationally recognised for his pioneering work in time series sensor data analytics, with over 4,000 citations. As one of the first researchers to formulate the sensor feature learning problem using deep neural networks, his 2015 IJCAI paper on this topic has been cited over 1,600 times. His research on remaining useful life prediction has also been widely adopted, with over 1,100 citations. He has received two Best Paper Awards at IEEE conferences for his contributions in this domain.

He is a leading contributor to positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, having co-authored the seminal 2005 ECML paper with Prof Bing Liu that coined the term. His earlier work in ICML, IJCAI, and ICDM has collectively attracted over 3,000 citations and continues to influence research in this area.
In social and biological network mining, Prof Li’s work has earned three Best Paper Awards and led to important advances in community detection, gene function prediction, and drug discovery across social and biological networks. He has also made impactful contributions to natural language processing and text analytics, with over 20 publications in top venues such as ACL, EMNLP, and WWW. His work in this area spans sentiment analysis, relation extraction, and weakly supervised learning for text classification, addressing key challenges in understanding and mining textual data at scale.
